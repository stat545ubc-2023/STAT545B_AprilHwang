# Welcome to STAT545B_AprilHwang :bowtie:

This repo is intended for submitting assignments for STAT545B at UBC. 

It contains the following:

* This _READ.md_ document, which gives an overview of this repo
* _AssignmentB-1.Rmd_, the first assignment for the course in rmd format
* _AssignmentB-1.md_, the first assignment for the course in md format
* _.gitgnore_ and _STAT545B.Rproj_, the mysterious files which were created with the .rmd and .md files. If deleted, the assignments do not display properly :scream:
