#Welcome to STAT545B_AprilHwang :bowtie:

This repo is intended for submitting assignments for STAT545B at UBC. 

It contains the following:

* This READ.md document, which gives an overview of this repo
* AssignmentB-1.Rmd, the first assignment for the course in rmd format
* AssignmentB-1.md, the first assignment for the course in md format
* .gitgnore and STAT545B.Rproj, the mysterious files which were created with the .rmd and .md files. If deleted, the assignments do not display properly :scream:
